This is just a simple movie jigsaw created with javascript and using the html5 canvas.

The original video will be broken up into peices and drawn on the canvas in a randomised order.  
The user can drag the peices around and try to put them together in the correct order.   Once the
peices have been placed in the correct order a congratulation message will be displayed on 
the canvas.

I hope you enjoy.

Aaron.
